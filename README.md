# Hi there, I'm Benjamin 👋👨‍💻

I'm a French 🇫🇷 Computer Science graduate passionate about tech, products, and curious about how things are made. I enjoy building stuff solving real-world problems around me. Technologies that I enjoy working with are mostly backend. They include Java, distributed sytems, Python, SQL and GraphQL.
